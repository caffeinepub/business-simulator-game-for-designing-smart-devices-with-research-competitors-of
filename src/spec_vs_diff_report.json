  "summary": "Diff adds a frontend store-network system (model, persisted Zustand store, Investments build UI, summary panels on Dashboard/Investments) and applies store-derived modifiers to product release calculations. Cloud save UI now includes storeNetwork in create/load flows with backward-compatible defaults. Backend changes are truncated, so persistence/types round-trip cannot be fully verified from provided evidence.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-21",
      "requirement": "Extend the saved game data model to include a player-built store network in shared types and ensure it round-trips through Cloud Saves (create/load) and backend persisted state.",
      "reason": "Frontend now sends/reads `storeNetwork` in cloud save payloads, but the diff summary does not show (due to backend truncation) that the backend save-slot types/storage actually include `storeNetwork`, nor that shared types exported from the backend include the required Store/StoreNetwork structures.",
